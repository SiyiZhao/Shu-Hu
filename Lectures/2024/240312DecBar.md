## Introduction

About the central bar in the Milky Way. 

MW has a psedo-bulge ($1.5$ kpc) and a long bar ($5.0\pm 0.2$ kpc).

The pattern speed of the bar ~ 40 km/s/kpc.
Observations prefer it slowing down with time.

## Content
- morphology
- origin
- origin of the old disk

## morphology

phase space spiral structure, perturbation of the orbits.  
ref. Antoja+23 Gaia DR3 

Find: two arms inside, one arm outside, cutoff at where the Sun locates.

simulation: two arms structure moves from inner to outside with time

## origin of the old disk

thin-disc like metal poor stars 

old hypothesis:
1. in-situ formation
2. move from inner  

new find: decelerating bar transfers from inner to outer disk
